# Makerspace Item Finder
We're making a digital assistant program that can find things in a database and tell a user its location within a makerspace.

Initial Team Members: Frank Czura, Ben Desiderato, Amelia Glenn, Warren Lester, Shane Riley

Current methods for cataloging items in makerspaces are inefficient to put together and manage
People currently use Amazon’s Alexa to automate solutions in their daily lives.


Items in the makerspace are too difficult to find. 
How might we improve the ease of use of makerspace catalogues?

ISSUE: wasted time
A few seconds on a small scale, hours on a large scale
STAKEHOLDERS:
Students
Professors
Swanson School of Engineering
If we don’t do anything, time continues to be wasted
ASSOCIATED COSTS:
Amazon Alexa platform
Wiring
Employee compensation
Routine maintenance

Action should be taken on this issue in order to maximize the time spent in the creative process.
Using Amazon’s Alexa, we can automate a database for the makerspace.
In order to do this, we plan on creating a prototype using AWS and Python
Testing Usability of this method on actual users of the makerspace
